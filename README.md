Hi, Welcome <br>
This code is a calculator for circular motion with constant acceleration condition. 
By inputing angular acceleration, initial angular velocity, radius, and time elapsed you can find the angular displacement, final angular velocity, distance traveled along the circular path, and final velocity. <br>
This code is c++ and written in qt creator version 6.5.3
